      <h3 style=color:white;>In Time</h3>

      2008, My dad gave me his old camera. I thought i could take some amazing pictures. Few weeks later, I gave up. Just because it was boring.
      2010, When i went to the college, I went through sort of an elongated confidence dilemma. I took that camera out, i thought it would help me to see things rationally.
      <br>
      <br>Through the camera, I started to see things that i've never seen. I loved it and started to capture the moment will last forever.

      Photographies in my portfolio captures the same time, same space but different energies.
      Most of them are related to my college years.
      I want to be the photographer who delivers the message of "life is different in every different angle" and gives people hope whose stuck in that corner.

      <br><br>Other than that,
      I do take selfportrait photogpraphies.
